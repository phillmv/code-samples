# Carmel extended CLI navigation samples

Samples in this folder, are functional equivalent of the original **[Aurelia skeleton navigation](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation)** set, without the two aspnetcore based samples which appear in the **[Carmel Full-stack samples](https://github.com/longarone/Carmel/tree/master/full-stack)** collection.


- **[esnext](https://github.com/longarone/code-samples/tree/master/basic/esnext)**
- **[esnext webpack](https://github.com/longarone/code-samples/tree/master/basic/esnext-webpack)**
- **[typescript](https://github.com/longarone/code-samples/tree/master/basic/typescript)**
- **[typescript-webpack](https://github.com/longarone/code-samples/tree/master/basic/typescript-webpack)**
***
- **[basic blog](https://github.com/longarone/code-samples/tree/master/basic/basic-blog)** sample is contributed by @nickshallee and it represents the start code for the whole **aurelia blog series** of distributed sample applications, used in the **[full-stack](https://github.com/longarone/code-samples/tree/master/full-stack)** and **[identity management](https://github.com/longarone/code-samples/tree/master/identity-management)** categories .

All of these samples are built with the **[Aurelia CLI](http://aurelia.io/docs/build-systems/aurelia-cli)** build system.
