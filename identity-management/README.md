# Identity Management Guide's samples

Samples in **[this folder](https://github.com/aurelia-community/AUCS-Code-Samples/tree/master/identity-management)**, used in the **[Identity Management Guide](https://aucs-publishers.gitbooks.io/identity-management-guide/content/)** are classified in two groups:

### SPA samples
- **[esnext](https://github.com/aurelia-community/AUCS-Code-Samples/tree/master/identity-management/esnext)**
- **[esnext webpack](https://github.com/aurelia-community/AUCS-Code-Samples/tree/master/identity-management/esnext-webpack)**
- **[typescript](https://github.com/aurelia-community/AUCS-Code-Samples/tree/master/identity-management/typescript)**
- **[typescript-webpack](https://github.com/aurelia-community/AUCS-Code-Samples/tree/master/identity-management/typescript-webpack)**


### Full stack samples 
- **[esnext-aspnetcore](https://github.com/aurelia-community/AUCS-Code-Samples/tree/master/identity-management/esnext-aspnetcore)**
- **[typescript-aspnetcore](https://github.com/aurelia-community/AUCS-Code-Samples/tree/master/identity-management/typescript-aspnetcore)**


Identity Management (aka authentication and authorization) is more often used in the context of Full stack applications, but it could be quite useful in the SPA group as well. It is important to realize that a SPA application is really a client server app when uses Identity Management service from a cloud PaaS like Auth0, Identity Server or AWS. 

**Note:**
By definition, the Identity Management Guide's samples collection is a lot richer than the basic **[Aurelia CLI](https://github.com/aurelia-community/AUCS-Code-Samples/tree/master/aurelia-cli)** set, because each sample from the basic set is used as the illustration how to use Identity Management tasks in the context of all supported Identity Management service providers - **[Auth0](https://auth0.com/)**, AWS Identity and Access Management **[(IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/)**, **[Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/)** and **[Identity Server](https://github.com/identityserver)**
